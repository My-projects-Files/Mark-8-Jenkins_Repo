# Mark-8
This is to understand jenkins pipelines


Install Jenkins, configure Docker as agent, set up cicd, deploy applications to k8s and much more.
## Things to note in groovy

- when we are using a script and calling a vaiable in sh we need to user "" insted of a ''.
- Groovy allows interations and having run different script in diff directories.

## AWS EC2 Instance

- Go to AWS Console
- Instances(running)
- Launch instances

### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins
Always use stable version and check it in the official website, so no issues are faced 
```
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu
```
```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password

Create First Admin User or Skip the step [If you want to use this Jenkins instance for future use-cases as well, better to create admin user]

Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.


## Docker Slave Configuration

Run the below command to Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
 
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

```
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```

Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

```
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.

## Kubernet cluster to deploy
we can configure the kubenet cluster like minikube, so we can run the jenkins in the cluster

we need to deploy a minikube cluster and jenkins in the machine and the connection need to be in place for the both jenkins and kubernet in minikube cluster. check this if we have an issue with the connectivity.
~~~
https://github.com/My-projects-Files/Mark-8/issues/11
~~~

## This is to configure minikube kubernet cluster as slave for the jenkins

first we need running minikube cluster and jenkins

we need to have kubernet plugins installed
~~~
jenkins ==>dashboard==>manage jenkins==>plugins==>kubernet
~~~
Then we can add kubernet as cloud slave
~~~
manage jenkins ==>clouds==> new cloud ==>name and select kubernet
~~~
now we need to configure the cluster to interact with the jenkins

open ./kube/config and there we find the keys path which is not accepted
~~~
cat <path>|base64 -w 0;echo
~~~
past the outputs and dont forget to edit the names as data
~~~
certificate-authority-data:

client-certificate-data:

client-key-data:
~~~
Then we can add the encripted keys and selet them in the jenkins cloud file for setting them as slaves
